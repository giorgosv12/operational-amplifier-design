# Designing an Operational Amplifier
***

The project aims to design an operational amplifier using Pspice, a popular circuit simulation software. The amplifier will be designed using nmos transistors and the initial values will be calculated using a custom algorithm with Matlab.

The first step is designing the operational amplifier circuit using Pspice, starting with the initial values calculated using Matlab. The circuit will be simulated using Pspice to test the performance and ensure that the amplifier meets the desired specifications.

Once the amplifier has been simulated with an ideal current source, the second step of the project involves replacing the ideal current source with a Wildar current source. This allows for a more accurate simulation of the amplifier circuit, since the Wildar current source can better model the behavior of real-world current sources.

After replacing the ideal current source with the Wildar current source, the amplifier circuit is re-simulated using Pspice. The simulation results are analyzed to ensure that the amplifier is still meeting the desired specifications, and any necessary adjustments are made to the circuit design as needed.

Finally, the performance of the operational amplifier circuit is evaluated in terms of its key performance parameters, such as gain, bandwidth, and noise. The results of the project are documented in the provided report, which includes details on the design and simulation of the amplifier circuit, as well as the performance results and any design considerations or trade-offs that were made during the project.
